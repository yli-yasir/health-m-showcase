## User Interface ( React )

I started my modern UI web development journey a few years ago with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) because I had heard that React had a steep learning curve. I had wanted to create an SSR App for better SEO ranking but unfortunately [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) did not meet my expectations.

I decided to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/) because I realized it had a richer and higher quality ecosystem. Although it took me a while to learn to do things in a declarative manner in React, I still personally found it easier and more straightforward to work with than Vue.
